<h1>There's a few ways to do this. This one uses a program, but this just goes to be a proof of concept. It would be pretty easy to make one from scratch. You can integrate with a dataset automatically using JSON files (pseudo text files, just in the form of a list) or just embed it into the link of the site itself using some wacky encryption stuff. Both methods are feasable, and I can help you with them if you want. If not I don't wanna be pushy. Just thought it was fun to mess around and make because I don't have much experience with Canvases in JS, and I find it interesting (gotta get all the practice I can). Anyway that's my proof of concept. If I got it wrong, my bad lol. Good luck with whatever you're doing lol. If you need help lmk <3.</h1>
